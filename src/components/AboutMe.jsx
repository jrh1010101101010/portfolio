          <h2>Hi my name is Jack!</h2>
          <p>
            I am a junior software engineer that has just graduated from general
            assembly in their software engineering immersive, as well as just
            graduating from university with a bachelors in psychological
            sciences. Over the course of years I have had an intrest tech that
            eventuated in taking a course in my second year of uni in programming.
            After loving the experince of learning to problem solve I decided that
            when i was to finish my course I would learn how to code and try to
            persue it professionally. I learned about general Assembly and took
            the plunge into programming where i have learned to love the art of
            speaking to the computer to problem solve and build applications to
            better the lives of end users.
